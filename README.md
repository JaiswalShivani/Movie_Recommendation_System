# Movie_Recommendation_System
The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.

Test the model -
http://jaiswalshivani.pythonanywhere.com/


Files Description -
1. requirments.txt - Contain dependencies of model.
2. movies.csv - CSV file that contain data on which I trained my model.
3. movie.py - Pyhton file (model file) where I build my model.
4. app_flask.py - Pyhton file that contain routing of my front end(all flask work).
5. index.html - default routing.
6. sub.html - after submitting route.
7. app_streamlit.py - Python file that contain frontend work(using streamlit).

Flow of project -
1. Install all dependecies mentioned in requirments.txt file.
2. Here you have to option to deploy movie recommendation system -
    1. Using Flask
    2. Using Streamlit
3. IF you are using flask then make a folder named as templates and cut paste index.html and sub.html into it so that our flask render_template can work properly.
4. Open cmd where you cloned the repo and run command - python app_flask.py.
5. It will give you a local url, copy and paste url on any browser .

7. Using pyhtonanywhere or streamlit you can host your model(website) free of cost.
